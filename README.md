# project-list

Quick access and switching between projects.

## Features

- **Project list**: browse and open projects saved in a `projects.json` config file.
- **Directory scanning**: auto-discover subdirectories as projects with glob patterns.
- **Glob paths**: wildcard patterns in `paths` expand to all matching directories at load time.
- **Tags support**: organize and filter projects by tags; a `#tag` query targets tags explicitly.
- **Multiple open modes**: open in a new window, swap, switch in the same window, or append to the current window.
- **Performance cache**: the built list is cached and kept in sync across windows.

## Installation

To install `project-list` search for _project-list_ in the Install pane of the Lumine settings or run `lumine --install lumine-code/project-list`.

## Commands

Commands available in `atom-workspace`:

- `project-list:toggle`: toggle the project list,
- `project-list:update`: rebuild the project list,
- `project-list:edit`: open the configuration file.

Commands available in `.project-list`, all listed with their keybindings in the item-actions list (F12):

- `project-list:open`: open the selected project in a new window,
- `project-list:swap`: open the selected project in a new window and close the current one,
- `project-list:switch`: switch the current window to the selected project,
- `project-list:append`: append the selected project to the current window,
- `project-list:paste`: insert the project paths into the active text editor,
- `project-list:dev`: open the selected project in a new window in dev mode,
- `project-list:safe`: open the selected project in a new window in safe mode,
- `project-list:external`: open the project folders externally (via open-external),
- `project-list:show`: show the project folders in the system file manager (via open-external),
- `project-list:refresh`: rebuild the project list, skipping the cache.

## Configuration

Projects are defined in `projects.json` in the Lumine config directory — open it with `project-list:edit`. The file holds an array of project objects:

| Setting    | Type                        | Description                                                                                 | Default                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `title`    | `string`                    | Project title shown in the list. `[tag]` patterns are styled as tags.                       | _mandatory_             |
| `paths`    | `string[]`                  | Project directories. Glob wildcards (`*`, `**`, `?`, `[...]`, `{...}`) expand at load time. | _mandatory_             |
| `tags`     | `string[]`                  | Tags used to organize and find projects.                                                    | `[]`                    |
| `scan`     | `boolean\|string\|string[]` | Scan paths and add matching subdirectories as projects. `true` is equal to `"*/"`.          | `false`                 |
| `icon`     | `string`                    | Custom icon of the project, e.g. `"icon-star"`.                                             | `"icon-file-directory"` |
| `devMode`  | `boolean`                   | Open the project in dev mode.                                                               | `false`                 |
| `safeMode` | `boolean`                   | Open the project in safe mode.                                                              | `false`                 |

Example `projects.json`:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "title": "My Library",
    "paths": ["C:/Work/library/"],
    "tags": ["work"],
    "scan": true,
  },
  {
    "title": "Packages",
    "paths": ["C:/Work/packages/*"],
    "tags": ["work"],
  },
]
```

The search query is matched against a combined text string in the format `#tag1 #tag2 Title`, so a `#`-prefixed term ranks tag matches higher. Match scores favor shorter titles and projects with fewer tags.

## Customization

Tweak the appearance of the list by adding CSS to your `styles.css`:

```css
.project-list .tag {
  color: var(--text-color-info);
}

.project-list .list-group {
  max-height: 20em;
}
```

## Services

- **[project-list](docs/project-list.md)** (`1.0.0`): provided to expose the project list manager — used by tree-view's empty project view to show a "List projects" button, and by window-title to resolve the current project title via `getCurrentProject()` / `onDidChangeCurrentProject()`.
- **open-external** (`^1.0.0`): consumed to open project folders externally or show them in the system file manager. For multi-path projects, the action is applied to each path.
